# Intelligent-CPU-Scheduler-Simulator

### OVERVIEW

This project implements an Intelligent CPU Scheduling Algorithm that optimizes process execution based on multiple scheduling parameters. 
The goal is to enhance CPU utilization, reduce waiting time, and improve overall system performance.

 
 ### FEATURES
   1. Dynamic priority-based scheduling
   2. Optimized turnaround and waiting times
   3. Intelligent decision-making for process selection
   4. Handles multiple processes efficiently

### How It Works

The algorithm gives priority according to process attributes (arrival time, burst time, priority, etc.).
It intelligently picks an effective process to execute Scheduling decisions dynamically to optimize CPU utilization.

### Programming Languages and Tools:

HTML – For structuring the user interface.

CSS – For styling and layout adjustments.

JavaScript – For handling logic, user interactions, and scheduling algorithms.

Chart.js – For visualizing the Gantt chart and other graphical representations.
